# [Budget Control App](budgetcontrolapp.vercel.app)

## About the app

Budget Control App is a simple one-page application, meant to be used to keep track of the incomes, expenses, current balance. It also allows the users to transfer money from the account to saving account, set and reset the target for the amount of savings. The project was created for study purposes. I practiced using React and TypeScript, and learned how to implement Redux and Material-UI.
